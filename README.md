#Basic Node/Express Weather App

*Basic Node/Express weather app using OpenWeather API to display weather in degrees Celcius, displays current skies description in images from OpenWeather as well.

**Things I enjoyed about building this app:** Building an Express server! It was really exciting, even though it was relatively easy to do. I felt like a "real" engineer when it got up and running on a local host. 

**Things that I struggled with while building this app:** I really struggled to get the images to display correctly...the weather would display correctly, but the images would break or the image would disappear immediately after the API was called, so it took several debugging attempts to get all components of the weather to display correctly.

**Things I learned through building this app:** Calling an API with JavaScript! I had previously built a similar app in Python, so it was really cool to see how to create a similar app in a different programming language.
